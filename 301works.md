# 301Works

301Works is a consortium of link shorteners that provide link mappings
in the case of shutdown.

## Issues

According to the [301Works FAQ](https://archive.org/details/301works-faq),
URL mappings of participating shorteners will be published upon closure.
However, all dumps have restricted access on the Internet Archive and
cannot be downloaded. This may be because the the planned 301Works link
resolving service has never been implemented. URLHero aims to become
that service for resolving links from defunct shorteners.

> In the case of closure of the URL shortening service, a participating
> company will agree to ... allow 301Works to publish the mappings so
> that users can remap any shortened URLs they may be using.
>
> ...
>
> If a participating company falls out of compliance with the terms of
> participation such as not updating the company archive, or failing to
> respond to inquiries from 301Works or IA staff after a two month
> period, 301Works will open the archived URL mappings to user access.
>
> ...
>
> For the sake of perceived privacy by end users, the retrieval of a
> long URL will require having the short URL, and only a single URL at a
> time will be returned through the planned IA 301Works interface.
